<p>I am tenacious. Which means when I want to do something I will do it. Here are a few examples:</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>When I was young, I had always wanted to be a clown (weird I know). One day I met a girl at college who went to
    clown school and was a clown in Texas.
    So I packed up and moved to Texas to become a clown. I worked for the same company, Party Animals, and not only was
    a clown, but was a small time magician and a Santa Clause .</li><br />
  <li>Tired of paying mechanics to fix my cars, I decided the next problem that came up, I would fix it.
    The next issue that came up? the timing belt needed replaced - which was extremely difficult for someone who had
    never done
    mechanics before. I studied YouTube, asked a friend on a coulple spots, got the manual, and finally with some trial
    and error I had fixed it, it actually ran (that was the scary part) and it still runs to this day.</li><br />


  <li>Getting a Masters had always been a dream of mine. So, while working for Sweetwater Sound (a music company in
    Indiana), I decided to get a Masters in Music Technology (I loved music and computers). I would go to class after
    work, then come home, be with my family, and then do homework. Finally, not only did I receive my Masters, but I
    also taught a two-week workshop at St. Francis University on Music Technology.</li>

</ul>

<p>
  *I love to do anything with technology, recording, coding, figure out new programs. At Sweetwater I had to learn over
  30 different types of software.</p>
<p>*Also, being creative is a past time of mine, whether it be making a comic book, creating a piano program, or
  learning how something
  works.</p>
